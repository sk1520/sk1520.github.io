			<h1 class="text-center">About Me</h1>
			<p class="">I am a computer science student persuing bachelors and that is my main goal for now, which i could expect early 2020. After getting my degree i would like to work as a web developer or a software engineer, working on amazing projects that many people would be able to use. I completed a few projects myself to keep myself busy and learn new things and new ways of approaching programming, doing these projects did just that, I learned new technologies, softwares, libraries, programming techniques, and much more. Below you can go over my projects and what i learned from them </p>

			<h1 class="text-center">MTA Android App</h1>
			<p>
				In this project, my peer and I worked on an android app. Our finished app is a utility app for New York's transit system MTA, the app is able to do various things to help people who rely on the MTA. Completing this project taught me very important things, it taught me using Android Studios, testing apps, catching bugs and fixing them, designing UX/UI, using outside libraries, using companies public data, and much more, but most importantly it taught me to work with someone else. Working with someone else, I learned that it's very different than working by yourself, in the process of working with my peer, I learned that the pacing is faster, and that communication is absolutley crucial in having a smooth process, me and my peer constantly communicated about our parts of assignments, we asked for help from eachother when one got stuck, we asked for feedback, and constatnly updated eachother about our parts of assignments, being this is our first big project that we both worked on, it went very well without much roadblocks because we constantly communicated with each other.

				<p class="font-weight-bold">App Features:  </p>
				<li class="features-list"><span class="font-weight-bold">Balance Calculator:</span> an MTA fare is $2.75 and because the MTA gives a 5% bonus to your card with $5.50 purchase or more many riders always have some kind of balance left over on their cards and some even discard their cards with sometype of balance left over because they can't get it down to $0. Our calculator calculates exactly how much you need to put in to your card so that when it's used it will always have a $0 balance.  </li>
				<li class="features-list"><span class="font-weight-bold">MTA Service Status:</span> using MTA data we were able to implement a real-time service status checker for buses, trains, tunnels, bridges, and Long Island Rail Road. </li>
				<li class="features-list"><span class="font-weight-bold">Other features:</span>  webview of MTA train and bus tracker, display of service prices, links to useful information, maps of all transportation services, MTA contact information, user logs saved in an SQLite database, and a user submitted feedback system for bugs and suggestions.</li>
