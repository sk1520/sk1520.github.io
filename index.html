				<p class="">I am a computer science student perusing bachelors and that is my main goal for now, which I could expect early 2020. After getting my degree I would like to work as a web developer or a software engineer, working on amazing projects that many people would be able to use. I completed a few projects myself to keep myself busy and learn new things and new ways of approaching programming, doing these projects did just that, I learned new technologies, software’s, libraries, programming techniques, and much more. Below you can go over my projects and what I learned from them.</p>

				<h1 id=""class="text-center">MTA Android App</h1>
				<p>
					In this project, my peer and I worked on an android app. Our finished app is a utility app for New York's transit system MTA, the app can do various things to help people who rely on the MTA. Completing this project taught me very important things, it taught me using different software’s like Android Studio, testing apps, catching bugs and fixing them, designing UX/UI, using outside libraries, using company’s public data, and much more, but most importantly it taught me to work with someone else. Working with someone else, I learned that it's a different process. In the course of working with my peer, I learned that the pacing is faster, and that communication is absolutely crucial in having a smooth and successful progression, me and my peer figured out quickly that constantly communicating about our parts of assignments is necessary for less bugs and faster development, we asked for help from each other when one of us got stuck, we asked for feedback, and constantly updated each other about our parts of assignments, being this is our first big project that we both worked on, it went very well without much roadblocks because we constantly communicated with each other early on.

					<li><p class="font-weight-bold">App Features:  </p></li>
					<li class="features-list"><span class="font-weight-bold">Balance Calculator:</span> An MTA fare is $2.75 and because the MTA gives a 5% bonus to your card with $5.50 purchase or more, many riders always have balance left over on their cards and some even discard their cards with some type of balance left over because they can't get it down to $0. Our calculator calculates exactly how much you need to put in to your card so that when it's used it will always have a $0 balance.   </li>
					<li class="features-list"><span class="font-weight-bold">MTA Service Status:</span> Using MTA data we were able to implement a real-time service status checker for buses, trains, tunnels, bridges, and Long Island Rail Road. </li>
					<li class="features-list"><span class="font-weight-bold">Other features:</span>  Custom tab of MTA train and bus tracker, display of service prices, links to useful MTA information, maps of all transportation services, MTA contact information, user history saved in an SQLite database, and a user submitted feedback system for bugs and suggestions.</li>

					<h1 class="text-center">Crypto Currency Ranker</h1>
					<p>
						This project was my third website i created, it's a simple dynamic website that would rank top 100 crypto currencies and will keep track of price changes, and their position in the list. I took on this challenge to gain experience working with a company’s public JSON API data. Using AJAX techniques i was able to retrieve JSON data from Coinmarketcap's public API and display it in a clean, aesthetic, and easy to read format. I learned a lot with this project, I leanred what JSON is and how it's very important way of getting and posting data, I also learned on how to use special techniques to get the data from JSON and ways of formating and displaying the data onto a website.

					<h1 class="text-center">Remaking a Website</h1>
					<p>
						This was my second website I created. In this project I chose an existing established businesses website <a href="http://www.c1mma.com/" target="_blank">c1mma.com</a> and remade it to look more aesthetic and have responsive characteristics. I chose to do this project to gain experience in rebuilding, and redesigning websites, while using the same resources the original website had, like color schemes, and pictures to save time, and stay true to the business’ identity. In this project I learned various things that are fundamental to web developing in today's times; I learned that responsive websites are a must, mobile users are very important in keeping businesses afloat and that means giving mobile users a pleasant experience. I also learned using different technologies, like Twitter Bootstrap that makes responsiveness and building websites much easier.

					<h1 class="text-center">Making a Website</h1>
					<p>
						This was my first website I ever created and it's my first project. In this project I created a website of an established business to practice web development. I took on this project to help me better understand on how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work. Doing this project I learned the basics of designing and making a website, and integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I also learned using JavaScript libraries.
