			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p class="">I am a computer science student persuing bachelors and that is my main goal for now, which i could expect early 2020. After getting my degree i would like to work as a web developer or a software engineer, working on amazing projects that many people would be able to use. I completed a few projects myself to keep myself busy and learn new things and new ways of approaching programming, doing these projects did just that, I learned new technologies, softwares, libraries, programming techniques, and much more. Below you can go over my projects and what i learned from them </p>
